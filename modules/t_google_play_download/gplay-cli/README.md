Requirements
----------
Works on GNU/Linux or Windows with `pip` and Python 2.9+. First of all, ensure these packages are installed on your system : 

- python-dev package -> `apt-get install python-dev`
- libffi package -> `apt-get install libffi-dev`
- python (>=2.5)

Then, you need to install some needed libraries with `pip` (consider using a venv):

- python-protobuf (>=2.4) to talking with Google Play Store -> `pip install protobuf`
- python-requests (>=0.12) -> `pip install requests`
- python-ndg-httpsclient for SSL connexions -> `pip install ndg-httpsclient`
- python-clint for progress bar -> `pip install clint`

If you want to use your own Google credentials, simply change them in the `credentials.conf` file with your own settings. 
If you want to generate androidID, see https://github.com/nviennot/android-checkin/, otherwise you could either use the given one (default) or use one of your devices ID.
